# Anti-theft system for a bike
Anti-thift system for your beloved bike.
Developed under a support of "Delft Open Hardware academy 2022".

## Motivation
- I'm a big fan of (race) biking. I'm always afraid of my bike got stolen when I park outside.
- In the Netherlands, bike thift is very common. My first bike in Delft got stolen after only two weeks of the purchese. I want to reduce unfortunate people like me.

### Ideas
The anti-theft system has two functions:
1. Prevent theft by warning sound
2. Track the bike's location in case the bike is moved (or when you just want to check that the bike is still there)

## Hardware 
- LilyGO TTGO T-Beam (v1.1 is used in this project)
