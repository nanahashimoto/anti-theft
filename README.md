# Anti_theft_system
Anti-thift system for your beloved bike.
Developed under a support of "Delft Open Hardware project".

#Motivation
- I'm a big fan of (race) biking. I'm always afraid of my bike got stolen.

- In the Netherlands, bike thift is very common. My first bike in Delft got stolen after only two weeks of the purchese. I want to reduce unfortunate people like me.
